        <p class="lead mb-4">Within the past few years I have gained a variety of work experience and skills. Each skill has been further developed and used in a variety of ways within my jobs. One position I worked was in dining. I would work a variety of positions, some alone, others with coworkers. Using social skills I was able to engage with customers and allow them to have an enjoyable experience when ordering. I worked serving people and being sure to listen carefully to what they want and any requests they may make. I also cooked meals and would do so in a timely manner. The work area was kept clean and sanitized. If I ever had any problems I would ask coworkers for advice or my department’s leader. I myself would have to help out anyone new to the position and teach them the best way to do a task and answer any questions they have. Moving from dining, I have worked a warehouse job for over a year and have been capable of doing multiple jobs in an efficient manner. I am able to lift heavy boxes, fill trailers with them, and stack totes. Working for 10 hours standing and constantly moving while keeping up with the work managers give. Using pallet jacks to carry boxes to their destination in the building, as well as wrapping all the items for safety. I am able to scan boxes and totes while keeping rate and moving pallets to their locations. I have also worked my way to a department in which I am able to move boxes down the line and clear any jams that are caused by them. If a tote is stuck I must also take care of it to ensure items are going to their proper destinations in a timely and efficient manner. Working the computer is another skill I have developed, making sure no jams are caused and stopping any machines that are causing issues.I have to be able to speak with individuals on the radio and answer any questions I may receive. If a manager has a question I have to be able to explain exactly what is happening or how something works. I must also report any issues with the conveyor belts, lines, etc. I am able to read where certain jams may take place on the computer and call them out for people to get. I myself may have to go downstairs and clear a jam as not everyone is trained in the same positions. Paying attention to your surroundings is key to this job and you must be able to do so for long periods of time. Another part of this position is of course being able to teach others what you do and how you do it. If they have any questions you answer them and physically teach them what they may have to do if there's a future issue and you’re not there. If I am to have any issues I am to ask one of the veteran workers or a processing assistant for help.
